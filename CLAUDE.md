# Project Guidelines

## Git Commit Convention

Follow [Chris Beams' commit message guidelines](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/):

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain *what* and *why* vs. *how*

### Example

```

This commit establishes the project documentation including:
- System overview and key features
- ASCII architecture diagram showing data flow
- Tech stack and project structure
- Failure scenarios for validation
- Development roadmap with milestones
```
